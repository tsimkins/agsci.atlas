# Program and Hyperlink

The **Program** and **Hyperlink** product types are links to external sites.

The only difference between these two types is that the **Program** has a `<text>` data field with text for the program landing page, and the **Hyperlink** does not.

In addition to the standard product fields, both types contain:

`<external_url>` - URL for external program site.
